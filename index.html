          Do you ever know what the fox says? I bet you can't mimic the sound, but you might have
          heard the song that is now coming from the background that set the world on fire nearly a
          decade ago. Since the Norway comedians Ylivis's music video went viral in 2013, many
          people might have been curious about the red fox's sound. It is time to hear the authentic
          sound instead of <q>Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa</q> or <q>Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho</q>. Also, some
          interesting facts regarding the red fox are to be explained, including what people have in
          mind about foxes and how blind people are.

        <h3>Range</h3>
        <p>
          In fact, a red fox is one of the most common species habituating around the globe. Its
          natural habitat is the Northern hemisphere<sup><a href="honesty.html#cite-7">[7]</a></sup
          >, but it successfully adapted to new environments. For example, in Australia, the red fox
          was introduced in the 1830s along with settlers in the British Colonies who wanted to
          continue red fox hunting and now became a notorious prosperous invasive species<sup
            ><a href="honesty.html#cite-3">[3]</a></sup
          >. The red fox lives in forests, grasslands, mountains even and deserts. In addition, they
          have expanded their territory into suburban areas and cities where people are dense.
        </p>
        <h3>Sound</h3>
        <p>
          Despite the abundant population, people barely know how it makes sounds. First, it is hard
          to describe the sound in simple words like people do with dogs, cats, or cows. Hearing the
          sound will help you understand the difficulty directly.

          The high-pitched howling<sup><a href="honesty.html#cite-11">[11]</a></sup
          >, almost sounding like screaming, is believed to be a <dfn>mating call</dfn>, which many
          animals use when they search for a partner. Second, red foxes are nocturnal animals that
          get active at night. Even though many foxes live in human neighborhoods, it is hard to run
          across them. Plus, people hearing their sounds might often consider them as owls'. Indeed,
          adult foxes could create 12 different sounds, including contact calls and greeting calls,
          while <dfn>kits</dfn>, young red foxes, identify 8 different sounds containing calls for
          attention or expression of dissatisfaction, according to scientific research<sup
            ><a href="honesty.html#cite-3">[3]</a></sup
          >. If you are eager to learn how their sounds are different depending on situations, play

          Regardless of cultures and geography, there are varied versions of mythology and anecdotes
          about "sly foxes." How come they gained the cunning impressions? The simple answer is
          their intelligence to the extent of confusing their enemies and ability to hunt their prey
          despite their tiny bodies. As animals that prefer solitary lives rather than flock lives,
          they know how to hunt on their own. Based on superior hearing and smelling ability, they
          could pose an opportunity of acquiring prey. For instance<sup
            ><a href="honesty.html#cite-14">[13]</a></sup
          >, red foxes can catch movement even beneath a meter thick snow layer. Furthermore,
          scientists believe that they can navigate the earth's magnetic field and use it to
          estimate the distance to the prey. This exceptional skill dramatically increases the hit
          rate from 18% to 73%. There is a video for those interested in how red foxes hunt using
          those abilities.

          Not only that, but red foxes have also developed individual strategies for their broad
          diet. Although rodents are the main prey, red foxes eat almost everything, including small
          birds, worms, insects, and vegetables<sup><a href="honesty.html#cite-7">[7]</a></sup
          >. Since they are not picky about food, they sometimes steal superiors' hunted preys or
          human's food. Also, it is common to see foxes in cities in the UK to search in garbage
          bins or look for leftovers for pets<sup><a href="honesty.html#cite-10">[10]</a></sup
          >. Finally, it indicates that red foxes can seamlessly settle down to a new environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, red foxes are clever enough to confuse their tracks and hide themselves to deceive
          their pursuers. For instance, they use other predators' scents to hide by rubbing
          themselves into it. Also, they spend most of their time in dens, which are burrowed
          underground. It enables them to move through sneakily, and they had several chambers to
          raise kits and store food, and there are at least two routes to the channels to help<sup
            ><a href="honesty.html#cite-2">[2]</a></sup
          >. Moreover, it has been said that red foxes are very careful about traps that hunters
          built and often outwit bred dogs by doubling back and climbing trees, so hunters and their
          dogs often struggle to catch them<sup><a href="honesty.html#cite-4">[4]</a></sup
          >.

          To sum up, foxes have successfully survived in the human-centric world thanks to their
          intelligence and excellent hunting skills, but they do not let themselves be exposed to
          humans or caught by humans. Consequently, it has solidified their representations as slay.
          However, labelling only foxes as cunning seems unfair. Foxes have been thriving because of
          their adaptability everywhere, but they have been convenient targets of humans because of
          the population that could harm farms or ecosystems. So how easy is it to justify hate
          against species that human is ignorant about? Some people still enjoy fox hunting as a
          sport, and fox fur accounts for the most fur trade. Foxes' hunting and stealth, or humans'
          pursuits of their tastes and pleasure. Which is unnecessary? We should ask ourselves who
          is more cunning.
