        I am <b>detail-oriented</b>, trying to be concise and create the best output under any
        circumstances. That leads to me being a leader occasionally. At the same time, based on many
        team assignment experiences in a previous and current major, I have developed balanced
        <b>collaborative skills</b>. I am always willing to listen to others and try to accept
        different opinions or better approaches. But, on the other hand, I work as such a
        <b>responsive</b> and <b>proactive</b> team member. I tend to double-check requirements and
        share feedback to enhance the quality of work, not only pulling my weight. I keep a strong
        sense of <b>responsibility</b>, contributing as much as possible regardless of my position.
        Currently, I am studying programming languages at Seneca to dream of being a web developer.
